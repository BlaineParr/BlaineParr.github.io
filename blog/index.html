            <h1><strong>Scrum: Adaptable Development</strong></h1>
			<h2><em>By: Blaine Parr</em></h2>
            <p>Scrum. Is it good? Is it bad? Should it be used? I’m going to write about my experience with scrum throughout a project I worked on with fellow college classmates for the majority of the past seven months.</p>
			<p>Firstly, a bit of information about scrum itself. Scrum is an adaptable, prototyping form of development. Rather than going through the software development life cycle (planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance) a single time over the course of several months, you complete the life cycle every two weeks over the same amount of time; this two week period is called a sprint.</p>
			<p>Before you can begin a sprint, you start off with meeting called sprint planning. In a spring planning, each team member is assigned a task (or multiple tasks) that they should complete before the sprint ends. These tasks are called user stories. Each story is assigned points. Points are essentially a difficulty value. Each story can range from one to three points; one being easy and three being hard. Each of these stories will be given a title and description. The description should be given from the point-of-view of the user. For example, a story’s title might be, “Build a Login Form.” The description would be, “As a user, I want a form where I can enter a username and password to log into the website. The username and password should be verified by a database.” You can also add success and failure criteria to a story’s description. Using my login form example, the success criteria would be, “The user is verified and successfully logs in.” The failure criteria wold be, “The user is not verified and is returned to the login page with a failure message.” You can also break down the story into individual tasks to go into further detail about the story.</p>
			<p>Your team will have a set amount of points that they plan to achieve every sprint. In my team’s case, we set out to complete ten points every single sprint. During some sprints, your team may choose to complete more points than was set. This is called overachieving. If you set out to achieve ten points every sprint, but decide to choose fifteen during a sprint, you’ve overachieved by five points.</p>
			<p>Part way through the sprint (twice every week in my case), you have another meeting called a stand-up. In this meeting, each team member states what they’ve completed so far, what they need to be done and any blockers (other tasks or stories) that need to be completed before the member can finish their story. The meeting is called a stand-up because everybody stands until the meeting is finished. By standing, members will usually want to get through the meeting quickly so they can get back to work. During this meeting, members can also request help if they are struggling with a specific task. If a member finishes a task early, they might help other members complete their stories, or complete an extra story.</p>
			<p>During the sprint, you keep track of your progress on a chart called a burndown. The burndown keeps track of how many points are remaining, how many days are remaining in the sprint, and the ideal amount of points completed per day in the sprint. A graph included in the chart will show a line showing the ideal burndown and another line showing the actual burndown. I’ve included an image of what a burndown chart might look like below.</p>
			<img src="/assets/images/burndown.png" />
			<p>The burndown chart gives a visual representation of how well a sprint is going. If the story points remaining is below the ideal burndown, the sprint is going great! The team is ahead of schedule! If it’s above the ideal burndown, the sprint is not going so well, and team members need to pick up the pace if they want to finish their stories on time. In the image I posted above, my team was a bit behind schedule until we were close to the end of the sprint. At that point, we picked up the pace and got everything done.</p>
			<p>At the end of a sprint, you hold a meeting called a sprint retrospective. In this meeting, you go over what went well during a sprint, what didn’t go well, and what you can improve. An example might be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What went well:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Overachieved by five points.</li>
					<li>Stories were finished early.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What did not go well:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Stories were not QA tested until late in the sprint.</li>
					<li>Stories were not accepted by the project owner until late in the sprint.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What can be improved:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Performing QA tests earlier.</li>
					<li>Project owner testing and accepting stories earlier.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Now let’s go over the roles of the team. The first role is the team member. Team members are everyone involved with working on the project. They work on and complete tasks as well as QA test other members’ stories. Next is the scrum master. The scrum master does everything a team member does, but they’re also responsible for running the meetings throughout the sprint. In our case, the scrum master set up the meetings, and filled in the documents for our sprint such as the burndown chart. The scrum master can, but does not have to, change after a sprint is finished. Lastly is the project owner. They are responsible for the project as a whole. They keep in communication with the client and are responsible for reviewing and accepting or denying any stories marked as finished by team members.</p>
			<p>Now that I’ve gone over what scrum is, I’ll go into the pros and cons of scrum and a bit about my experience with it throughout this project.</p>
			<p>As I mentioned earlier, scrum is very adaptable. This is the complete opposite of the waterfall method, which is very predictable. This means that with waterfall, you’ll get something very close to the original design plan. With scrum, you can adjust the project at any time if a client is unhappy with the way a piece of the project is going, or wants to make a change to the original plan.</p>
			<p>In the project I was involved in, we were originally planning to build a simple clock-in, clock-out system for the workers of a family owned business. It was intended to simply speed up the sign-in and out process for workers who were currently signing-in on paper. After we finished this, the customer also requested that if we had enough time, we could also build an online system for their maintenance logs. By the time we were finished with the project, it turned into a full management system. It did the clocking-in and out functionality, but with a lot more. It could now track when each section of workers is supposed to be clocked-in and out, calculate overtime hours, mark employees if they didn’t clock-in or out, send an email to HR to notify them that an employee was no longer employed with the company, track each individual employee’s clock-times and more! The maintenance log system, never happened.</p>
			<p>The adjustability of scrum is both its biggest advantage and disadvantage. If we weren’t using the scrum method to build this project, the project would’ve been what it was originally set out to be. A simple clock-in, clock-out system. All of the other functionality would have never came to be. Throughout each sprint, our client made numerous suggestions for functionalities of the project. We were able to add this extra functionality because each development cycle is over in two weeks. Needless to say, our client was very happy with the project, but would also keep making further requests. This is where the downfall lies. You do end up with a much more impressive project, but that more impressive project may be at the cost of multiple other projects. Due to the extra amount of work we put into this project, the maintenance log system was never even looked at. Also in my experience, the client will always find something else to add. You may think you’ve added everything the client could want, but there’s always more. This usually means you’re going to be adding many complicated functions. The work will start off easy and become progressively harder as the clients requests increase.</p>
			<p>There are further advantages to scrum though, also in the way team members interact. If a team member isn’t completing their work, you can notice this a week into a project rather than when the project is coming to a close and a lot of important functionality that they were supposed to handle, is missing. You can handle the situation with these team members and get them back on track very quickly.</p>
			<p>You also get to keep a very tight look at how the project is going with the weekly stand-ups and the end of sprint retrospectives. The stand-ups are a great tool for seeing when a team member needs help with a task, and also for seeing how well a sprint is going overall. The burndown chart is an excellent visualization tool for this. Below the ideal burndown line? We’re doing great! Above it? Let’s pick up the pace. At the retrospective meetings, you can go over what went well so you can try to repeat it for future sprints, and what didn’t go well so you can solve those problems for next time. Scrum gives you a lot of control in this way.</p>
			<p>Overall I think scrum’s advantages outweigh the disadvantages and if you need to choose between scrum and waterfall, scrum is the way to go. While you may have to work harder on a single project, that project will end up far more polished, and you’ll have a lot more control if something is to go wrong during development.</p>
